										<h2>My Profile </h2>
										</header>
									<p>Hi my name is Waleed toma I am 23 years old and I have been interested in learning about technology and computers ever since I got my first computer when I was 12 years old. I have chosen RMIT to study Information technology because it was highly recommended to me by my cousins who have studied there and graduated there Bachelor of Accounting. I'm interested in I.T because of how its evolving and how many of us use and rely on it through our lives.  </p>

									<h3>Personal Information</h3>
									<p>I was born in Baghdad Iraq in 1996 I'm Assyrian and speak Assyrian and English. Where is Assyria? well, it doesn't exist anymore it was a part of Iraq until it collapsed between the year 612 BC and 609 BC. So we're like the aboriginals of Iraq when we lived there. I understand Arabic but don't speak it. I enjoy playing soccer and swimming with my friends. When I have some free time at home I also like playing some pc games like counter strike and dota. My student number is s3776749 and email is S3776749@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>

									<h3>IT Interests</h3>
									<p>My Interest in I.t is in programming I would like to know how to write code in a programming language to build a program that other people will use. It's also fun to see other people using what you have made and tell you where you can improve on the product. This interest started about a year ago when I was trying to learn it by myself I found it hard learning it on my own so I chose to study at RMIT at it's going really well so far.<br>I chose RMIT because it was recommended to me by my friends and cousins who graduated there. Having read some good reviews of this university this was the one I chose through open universities Australia. I hope to complete this i.t course and find a job that's right for me<br>I'm expecting to learn new things throughout the course such as security, database, and troubleshooting. Also learning HTML, HTTP, and CSS all of these I'm not familiar with and want to learn most of them. I want to also understand databases and how they work all of these I'm looking forward to learning.</br></p>

									<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
									<p>An ideal Job after graduation would look like this <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38578260?searchrequesttoken=005d7618-6e5b-4cc9-a4aa-721203e49cf0&type=standard" width=100>Click here for the link.</a> This is the sort of job I think I can get into after graduating. Its a graduate developer / Technical support role in Melbourne. For me, to succeed in a position like this I will need. It looks appealing to me because it's a good place to start my i.t career and further develop my skills in the industry. its a customer service technical support role which I think I'm capable of doing now but there's more experience needed for the other roles you have to do. The job requires you to have the following:<ul><li>You will need to have a degree in Information Systems and computer science or a similar degree</li><li>Understanding of MS Windows 10</li><li>Understanding of MS Windows 10</li><li>Programming knowledge & experience an advantage such as VB Scripts, HTML, Javascript and SQL.</li><li>Strong communication with customers and co-workers</li><li>Ability to learn quickly on your own and under minimal supervision</li><li>Experience in conflict-resolution applied at both a customer & internal level</li></ul>For the skills I currently have are a certificate 2 and 3 in Information technology which I did 2014 and 2015.i have worked in hospitality before as a kitchen hand before dealing with customers and handling cash. Also helping solving problems that customers have or helping other workers. A plan to obtain these skills the job needs are for me to complete this bachelor. there are a lot of other skills needed that the job specifically says like HTML, Javascript which I am learning through the course<br>

									    <p>Test my creativity from <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/" target="_blank">Visit Test my creativity </a> Creativity score 61.28. These results don't mean much to me because as I get older I feel like I'm changing every day. They may show how my personality and learning is like now but I'm not sure how accurate that will still be in 2 or 3 years. If I'm part of a team I think I can work together fine in a team even though the test says I prefer to work alone. Maybe when we've formed the team I should work on one side of the project by myself after we've thought out what how we all want to work.</p>

										<h3>Project Idea</h3>
										<p><b><u>Overview: </u></b>For the project idea that we will be doing in a group I was thinking to make a game like dota but with cross-platform play. 
										   People can play it from any device even from their desktop PC's to tv with apple tv. They can even play it on their iPhones and Android devices
										   even while they're not at home. It should be a strategy based game aimed at older people who don't play video games. that's why we will make it
										   easy to play and aimed specifically for the elders but it can be played for all ages. It should be addictive, fun and good at making the player
										   think strategically.</p>
										<p><b><u>Motivation: </u></b>The Motivation here is to start getting older people to start playing games from anywhere. This is to get them to think,
											 strategize and have fun. Also, there have been some studies where elderly people who play video games even just occasionally are more social and 
											 less likely to develop depression than those who don't play. Some studies were linked to their happiness and Energy for those who did play. We want
											  them to be more alert and also getting use to learning new technologies as we update the game to improve the experience.  </p>
										<p><b><u>Destription: </u></b> It's a cross-platform game so it can be played from any hardware the player wishes. When they first download it to where
											 ever they want they will be introduced to the rules of the game that are laid out very simply for them. We might even tell them its a game aimed for
											  elderly people but remember anyone can play it. after they have read the rules written simply which shouldn't take long because they probably don't
											   want it to be hard since they don't play any video games they will begin to practice the game. Each step they take in the game should be very easy
												at first then gradually start to get harder with each step. The game itelf is a 7 vs 7 online or offline strategy game where the goal is to level
												 up your character and destroy the enemy teams base to win. the controls of the game are very simple but an advanced player who played similar games
												  like this can change the controls and customize them to his or her preferred way of playing. they will have to enter their age and name when they 
												  first begin the tutorial and practice lesson. They will be asked some questions about how much video games they play and their language and most
												   importantly their age. if they say that they have never played video games before and there over 23 the game will automatically give them the 
												   easiest control layout to play with. If they say they're over 30 and never played video games in their life we will show them a message then a
													video about why it's actually good to play video games. the video and messages will tell them the benefits that video games are having in adults
													 and elderly people. But what about those who were younger and wanted to see the video about why games are beneficial for you? well, they don't
													  see it if they want to see it it's in the main menu where they can watch it if they wish. they'll be introduced to an easy to use but an 
													  effective character that will help them make get used to the mechanics of the game. They will be taught how to purchase new items new gear for 
													  their character to make them stronger and why this is needed to win or increase the chances of winning. Also, they need to be able to work and
													   communicate with other teammates that can be either set to an offline mode or an online mode if they want to do that.they can also choose how
														many players they want to vs and be teamed up with for example 2 v 2 or 4 v 4. An advanced player can even choose 1 v 5 or a 2 v 7 if he or she
														 wants that challenge. Services with this product with cross-platform and frequent updates to add new characters and bug fixes to squish any 
														 bugs that are interfering with the game. </p>
										<p><b><u>Tools and Technologies: </u></b> The tools needed are software video game developers that will use suggest the preferred games software like unity or construct2
											They need to be creative and come up with new ideas never seen before and different from dota or league of legends. The in-game environment should be 3d while using unity
											 or another game development engine the developers will choose. C# should also be known to the game developers since it is the primary language used by the game engine. We also need to pay for the hardware 
									like the servers and make sure they transmit enough data so there will be no delays from the player's inputs to the server. </p>	
										<p><b><u>Skills Required: </u></b>The skills required and people needed for this project is especially video game developers. These developers must be experienced and have worked on 
                                            a similar project like this before. we need people to design a beautiful but simple user interface that can be navigated around with no bugs occurring. this is when we need UI and UX 
											designers that are also familiar and experienced with eliminating any bugs that happen. The characters will be designed in there own unique way by these designers working with the game developers very closely.</p>
										<p><b><u>The Outcome: </u></b>The Outcome we want is to see elderly people feel more alert, awake and happy and more importantly have fun. if the game is successful we will continue to support it with updates 
											and releasing new characters with different skills to learn and play around with. The goal was to make the elderly to play from anywhere and with whatever hardware and technology they
											 want to play it on. we will show advertisements and show who its aimed for and why. And if it is super successful then we might make a new version of the game.   </p>
